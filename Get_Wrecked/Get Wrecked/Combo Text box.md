Have the text get more "excited" the higher the combo
	- Have it wiggle more
	- Have the color change
	- etc.
- Have text break or explode or dissolve when the combo is broken
- Maybe animate every character separately 
	- or at least animate the updated numbers separately  
- Wiggle scales to 10
	- Max wiggle at 10
- At 20, get rainbow
	- We can also adjust aspects of the rainbow with increasing combo from 20 to 50
- At 50, Change from wiggle to something else
	- Like pulsing in scale
	- And also a pulsing in illumination
