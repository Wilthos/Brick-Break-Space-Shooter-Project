 Keep track of level stats and build ranking system
	- Number of enemies killed (helps grade)
		- Tracking:
			- Yes
		- This can be tracked along with Number of enemies getting past you on screen, which we are also tracking
		- Together we get: Total_Enemies = Number_of_Enemies_Killed + Number_of_Enemies_Passed 
		- So we only need to really track Number_of_Enemies_Killed/Total_Enemies which will be 0 - 100%
		- Weight:
			- This weight should be heavy to the rank
			- Maybe 60%-70%?
	- Time taken to beat level (help the quicker)
		- Tracking
			- No
		- Should probably be ralted to the number of spawners and bricks in play
			- You should get a longer limit the more "stuff" there is on the screen
	- Damage Taken
		- Tracking
			- Yes
	- ~~Accuracy? (Hits/shots fired)~~
		~~- Not sure we need this~~
	- Balls lost
		- Tracking
			- Yes
- Ideas for formula for ranks
	- Grade system like NA school
		- Each category will get a grade of 1-100
			- This can be done anyway really
		- Each category will also have a weight to it.
