- destroying some bricks give items
- Let you pick ball launch angle
	- Maybe slow down time when you launch the ball
- Make the game a bit musical
- More intense graphics and animations the higher the combo?
- Lasers do chip damage to bricks?
	- Maybe an upgrade that allows that?
- To make the game even more varied and involved, we can keep track of the enemies that get past you past a certain point. You would then need to do a whole other game mode after to complete the level.
	- like chase down the guys you didn't get.
	- Could be cool
