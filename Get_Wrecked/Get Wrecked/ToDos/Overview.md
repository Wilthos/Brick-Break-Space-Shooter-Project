- Mostly single-player game combining space shooter and brick break elements
- Enemy spawners are protected by brick barriers.
- You are a ship/mech/character with two main weapons: lasers and a breaker ball.
- Laser fire can harm the enemies, but not the barriers; and your ball can damage the barriers, but not the enemies.Â 
- This leads to a balance of shooting enemies and keeping the ball in the play area.
