- reimagine enemy spawn rates
	- Overall, we need to balance the rate of laser fire and the number of enemies that are spawned. We
	- Ideas for Enemy Spawn Rates
		- Link the enemy spawn rate to the number of spawners on screen?
	- Ideas for Weapon Fire Rates

			- I think this will work well
	- Maybe we can give (some) enemies a less random and more methodical spawn animation and rate? 
- **Keep track of level stats and build ranking system**
	- Number of enemies killed (helps grade)
	- Number of enemies getting past you on screen (hurts grade)
	- Time taken to beat level (help the quicker)
	- Damage Taken (hurt)
	- Accuracy? (Hits/shots fired)
- ~~Work on a Combo System for Killing aliens~~
- ~~Ball bounce off spawner but not damage it.~~
- Have numerical damage done momentarily flash above enemy and player when damage done

	- Animation works but can definitely be tweaked
		- update font color
		- update font type
		- see if there is a preset font style (LabelSettings?) that we can try
- Ball upgrade where it periodically bursts and hurts non-brick enemies
- ~~Make smaller bricks with placeholder assets.~~
- ~~Set up max ship health stuff~~
- **Combo Broken animation** 
- Lively combo counter animation ([[Combo Text box]])
- come up with some unique enemy types
- Shield item for ship?
- [[World and Level Select Screens]]
