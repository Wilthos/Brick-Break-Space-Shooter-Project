- Create a HealboxCompnent (area 2D), based on the HitBoxComponent
	- it will emit a "heal" signal that a HealCompnent will interpret for the node's HurtBoxComponent
- also create a Heal Component that will be meant to pair with HurtboxComponents to tell the HurtboxComponent how to handle the HealBoxComponent
